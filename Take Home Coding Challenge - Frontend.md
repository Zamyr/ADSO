# [cite_start]Take Home Coding Challenge - Frontend Engineering [cite: 1, 2]

## [cite_start]Overview [cite: 3]

Build a user directory UI that displays and manages user profiles. [cite_start]Should be responsive and intuitive. [cite: 4]

## [cite_start]Prerequisites [cite: 5]

* [cite_start]You may use any programming language and framework. [cite: 8]
* [cite_start]Your project must be buildable and runnable [cite: 9]
* [cite_start]Please include step-by-step instructions on how to do so, we value portability and ease of use. [cite: 10]
* [cite_start]A ReadMe.md file should be added to the root of your solution with adequate documentation to setup and run your solution. [cite: 11, 12]
* [cite_start]Please include instructions on how to run tests in your project [cite: 13]
* [cite_start]If you used Claude (or any Al) to help build this, please include your CLAUDE.md context file. [cite: 14]
* [cite_start]Submit a compressed file of your project before your onsite interview panel [cite: 15]
* [cite_start]Also note: [cite: 16]
    * [cite_start]Email the compressed project back to us [cite: 17]
    * [cite_start]We will walk through your code during a portion of the on-site interview [cite: 18]
    * [cite_start]We are looking to understand how you solve problems [cite: 19]

## [cite_start]What We're Looking For [cite: 20]

* [cite_start]Working Ul that displays and updates profiles [cite: 21]
* [cite_start]Reasonable component structure [cite: 22]
* [cite_start]Responsive design [cite: 23]

## [cite_start]Requirements [cite: 24]

[cite_start]Design and implement a simple user directory UI that must: [cite: 25]

* [cite_start]Be ready for production deployment. [cite: 26]
* [cite_start]The UI should have the following views/pages: [cite: 27]
    * [cite_start]Users List [cite: 28]
    * [cite_start]User Detail [cite: 30]
    * [cite_start]Create/Edit Form [cite: 31]
* [cite_start]Your application should talk to this endpoints (Mock the APIs): [cite: 33]
    * [cite_start]`GET /profiles` [cite: 34]
    * [cite_start]`GET /profile/{id}` [cite: 35]
    * [cite_start]`POST /profile` [cite: 37]
    * [cite_start]`PATCH /profile/{id}` [cite: 38]

## [cite_start]Notes [cite: 39]

* [cite_start]Focus on UX and code organization [cite: 40]
* [cite_start]Loading and error states matter [cite: 42]
* [cite_start]Additionally, consider the following: [cite: 41]
    * [cite_start]What questions might you have for product owners that could clarify or inform the need to scale your service? [cite: 43]
    * What technologies would you pick? [cite_start]Why? [cite: 44]
    * [cite_start]How would you monitor your UI? [cite: 45]
